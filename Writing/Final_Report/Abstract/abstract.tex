This investigation focuses on leveraging deep learning techiniques of cryptocurrency trading algorithms. We explore classic financial mathematics models of vector auto-regressive (VAR/VARMAX) and more complex recurrent neural networks (RNN) and a hybrid of the two in residual recurrent neural networks (R2N2). The find that the VAR model has phenomenal test period performance and thus props up the R2N2 model, while the RNN performs poorly. This implies that further investigation should focus on the best cost funcitons for neural network training for financial algorithms.
