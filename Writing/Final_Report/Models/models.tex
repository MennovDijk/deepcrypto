\subsubsection{Multi-Coin Thesis}

Our exploration into multi-coin models (as opposed to a pure auto-regressive single asset approach) is base upon the thesis that of the five main coins there is a base amount of value that flows between the coins, and that there is some sort of leading-lagging dynamic amongst the high market-capitalization currencies.
