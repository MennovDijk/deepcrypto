Throughout our investigation we gained curiosity towards other lines of questioning; unfortunately the timeline of this project did not allow for the pursuit of all. In addition to what was mentioned at the end of the discussion section, here are our unpusued curiosities:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Exploring how training on narrower, more granular recent data effects model predicatibility. This could shed light on the speed of regime change for the cryptocurrency market.

	\item Classification prediction of positive or negative returns

	\item Multi-label Classificaiton of down a lot, down, up, up a lot

	\item Algorithmic allocation strategies for multi-coin signals

	\item VARMAX input into R2N2

	\item Explore use of normal feed forward networks, RNN-NARX, or CNN

	\item Explanatory investigation into what R2N2 is learning

	\item Predictive algorithms for volume so as to know when liquidity is sufficient for trades

	\item Explore relation of predictive accuracy to algorithm returns

	\item Signal with attention layer on top of RNN/R2N2

	\item Explore mini-batch learing options for financial time series data

\end{itemize}
